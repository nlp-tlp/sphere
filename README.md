## Getting started

### Step 1: Data preparation

- Download the datasets [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/betae/KG_data.zip), then move `KG_data.zip` to `./sphere/` directory

- Unzip `KG_data.zip` to `./sphere/data/`:

  ```bash
  cd sphere/
  unzip -d data KG_data.zip
  ```

### Step 2: Dependencies installation

- For `condaers`:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f requirements.yml
  conda activate sphere
  ```
- For `pipers`:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source ./venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Step 3: Model

- There are three datasets: FB15k-237, FB15k, NELL995
- We recommend that you start with the FB15k-237 and FB15k first for faster implementation and less GPU memory requirements than that with the NELL dataset.

#### Step 3.1: Training query embeddings models

1. Run the scripts `scripts/*.sh` at the parent directory `sphere/` to train query embeddings models (GQE, Query2Box, SpherE) for the default dataset `FB15k-237`
2. Uncomment others in `*.sh` to train models using other datasets `(FB15k/NELL995)`. For example, type the following command to train a specific model:

- **SpherE** (trained using 1p queries only)

  ```bash
  scripts/sphere_1p.sh
  ```

- **GQE**

  ```bash
  scripts/gqe.sh
  ```

- **GQE** (trained using 1p queries only)

  ```bash
  scripts/gqe_1p.sh
  ```

- **Query2Box**

  ```bash
  scripts/query2box.sh
  ```

- **Query2Box** (trained using 1p queries only)

  ```bash
  scripts/query2box_1p.sh
  ```

#### Step 3.2: Move the checkpoint

- After successfully training a specific model, copy or move its checkpoint file `checkpoint`
  under the `logs/` directory to the directory `clqa/pre_trained_clqa/`, to prepare for the next step. For example,
  the final path of the checkpoint file is as follows:

  ```bash
  clqa/pre_trained_clqa/checkpoint
  ```

  or rename it

  ```bash
  clqa/pre_trained_clqa/FB15k-237_sphere_256
  ```

#### Step 3.3: Generalizing query embeddings to answer complex logical queries using fuzzy logic

1. Run the scripts `scripts/*.sh` at the parent directory `sphere/` to generate atomic query matrix (neural adjacency matrix) and to generalize query embeddings models (GQE, Query2Box, SpherE) using the default dataset `FB15k-237` for complex logical queries.
2. Ensure that this option `--clqa_path`, for example, `--clqa_path clqa/pre_trained_clqa/FB15k-237_sphere_256` matches to the name of checkpoint of pre-trained model, e.g. `FB15k-237_sphere_256`. You can rename `checkpoint` to `FB15k-237_sphere_256` for distinguishing other checkpoints.
3. Ensure that this option `-d`, for example `-d 256`, matches to the dimension option `-d 256` of pre-trained model.
4. Uncomment others in `*.sh` for other datasets `(FB15k/NELL995)`.

- **SpherE** (trained using 1p queries only)

  ```bash
  scripts/sphere_qto.sh
  ```

- **GQE**

  ```bash
  scripts/gqe_qto.sh
  ```

- **GQE** (1p version)

  ```bash
  scripts/gqe_qto_1p.sh
  ```

- **Query2Box**

  ```bash
  scripts/query2box_qto.sh
  ```

- **Query2Box** (1p version)

  ```bash
  scripts/query2box_qto_1p.sh
  ```
